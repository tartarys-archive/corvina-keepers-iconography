## 1. Purpose of Heraldry

Heraldry within Corvina Keepers serves a single purpose:

**to mark continuity of guardianship across time.**

It does not establish power.  
It does not grant privilege.  
It records responsibility.

---

## 2. Heraldry vs Branding

Corvina Keepers heraldry is explicitly **not branding**.

| Branding | Heraldry |
|--------|----------|
| Promotes | Records |
| Persuades | Identifies |
| Changes with trends | Remains stable |
| Audience-focused | Time-focused |

Heraldic symbols exist for future witnesses, not present viewers.

It does not override them.
