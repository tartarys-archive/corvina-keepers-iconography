## 1. Purpose and Meaning

The Corvina Keepers Ceremonial Seal is the primary physical symbol of authenticity
within the Corvina Keepers framework.

Its purpose is:
- to authenticate physical documents,
- to ceremonially validate archival acts,
- to connect digital records with physical reality,
- to represent continuity, responsibility, and guardianship.

The seal does **not** grant legal authority by force.  
Its authority derives from **transparency, public witnessing, and archival traceability**.

### 2.2 Guardians

- Ravens face inward toward the book, signifying protection and vigilance.

### 2.3 Text (Optional Ring)
- Circular inscription (if used):
  - `CORVINA KEEPERS`
  - Optional secondary text: `GUARDIANS OF THE ARCHIVE`
